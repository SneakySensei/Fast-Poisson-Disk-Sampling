# Fast Poisson Disk Sampling in Arbitrary Dimensions

A simple implementation of Robert Bridson's [Fast Poisson Disk Sampling in Arbitrary Dimensions](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~rbridson/docs/bridson-siggraph07-poissondisk.pdf) in TypeScript using [P5.js](https://p5js.org/).

I wrote this to understand the algorithm for another project I'm working on.

## How to run locally?

After cloning the repo, run the following command:

```bash
yarn && yarn dev
# or
npm i && npm run dev
```
